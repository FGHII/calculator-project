//Issues
//RESOLVED - Issue 1:  press two operators in a row (same operator and different operators) - current display value and operator keeps pushing to calculation array
//RESOLVED - Issue 4: calculate 8 x 6 = then press equals a few more times...it repeatedly adds the answer to the array
//RESOLVED - Issue 2:  after pressing equals after a calculation, press a number after that - should it be concatenating to the current total?
//calculate 8 / 4 = then press a number - it concatenates it to the current display - accepted functionality/use case
//RESOLVED - Issue 3:  8 + 8 = then do + 4......

//RESOLVED - Issue 5: 8 + 1 then press an operator again - doesn't calculate the 8 + 1.  can't chain operations together
//Issue 6:  14 + 4 = then press equals again then press + 4 - it concatenates to the string
